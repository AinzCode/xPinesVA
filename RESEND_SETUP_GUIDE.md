2. **Click:** "Add Domain"
3. **Enter your domain:**
   ```
   pines-va.com
   ```
   (Don't include `www` or `http://`)

   ```
   Type: TXT
   Name: _resend
   Value: resend-verify-xxx-yyy-zzz
   
   Type: MX
   Name: @
   Value: feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com
   Priority: 10
   
   Type: TXT
   Name: @
   Value: v=spf1 include:amazonses.com ~all
   ```

5. **Add these records to your DNS provider:**
   - GoDaddy: DNS Management
   - Cloudflare: DNS settings
   - Namecheap: Advanced DNS
   - Vercel: Domains ‚Üí DNS Records
   - etc.

6. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS propagation

#### Can't verify domain right now?

**No problem!** Use the default Resend domain for testing:

- Emails will say "via resend.dev"
- Works fine for development/testing
- Upgrade to custom domain later
