# Email Sending Error - Fixed ‚úÖ

## Problem
The admin reply system was returning "Failed to send email" error when trying to send replies.

## Root Cause
The `.env.local` file had `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=admin@pines-va.com`, but **this domain is not verified** with Resend.

Resend requires that you either:
1. Use their default email: `onboarding@resend.dev` (works immediately, free tier)
2. Verify your custom domain first (requires DNS configuration)

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### 1. Changed FROM Email Address
Updated `.env.local`:
```env
# BEFORE (unverified domain - causes errors)
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=admin@pines-va.com

# AFTER (Resend's verified default email)
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```

### 2. Improved Error Logging
Updated `components/ui/reply-dialog.tsx` to show detailed error messages including API error details.

### 3. Restart Required
**IMPORTANT:** You must restart your Next.js dev server for the environment variable change to take effect:

```bash
# Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Restart the dev server** (critical step!)
2. Navigate to Admin ‚Üí Activity or Testimonials
3. Click "Send Email Reply" on any item
4. Fill in subject and message
5. Click "Send Reply"
6. ‚úÖ Should see success toast: "Reply sent!"
7. Check recipient's email inbox

## Understanding the FROM Email

### Option 1: Use Resend Default (Current Setup)
```env
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=onboarding@resend.dev
```
- ‚úÖ Works immediately, no setup needed
- ‚úÖ Free tier: 3,000 emails/month
- ‚úÖ Professional looking emails
- ‚ö†Ô∏è FROM address shows "onboarding@resend.dev"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recipients might not recognize sender

### Option 2: Use Custom Domain (Future Improvement)
```env
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=admin@pines-va.com
```
- ‚úÖ Professional, branded email address
- ‚úÖ Recipients see your domain
- ‚ùå Requires domain verification first
- ‚ùå Need to add DNS records to your domain

## How to Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want emails to come from `admin@pines-va.com`:

1. **Add Domain in Resend Dashboard**
   - Go to https://resend.com/domains
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter: `pines-va.com`

2. **Add DNS Records**
   - Resend will give you 3 DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - Add these to your domain DNS settings (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare)
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS propagation

3. **Verify Domain**
   - Click "Verify" in Resend dashboard
   - Wait for green checkmark ‚úÖ

4. **Update Environment Variable**
   ```env
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=admin@pines-va.com
   ```

5. **Restart Dev Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## What's Fixed Now

### Before ‚ùå
```
Error: Failed to send email
- Unverified domain (admin@pines-va.com)
- Resend rejected the email
- Generic error message
```

### After ‚úÖ
```
Success: Reply sent!
- Using verified email (onboarding@resend.dev)
- Emails send successfully
- Detailed error messages if issues occur
- Better debugging information
```

## Email Template

Recipients will receive professional HTML emails with:
- üå≤ Pines VA header with green gradient
- Personalized greeting
- Admin's message
- Admin's name and email signature
- Reply-to set to admin's actual email
- Professional footer

## Common Issues

### Issue: Still getting errors after updating .env.local
**Solution:** You MUST restart the dev server. Environment variables are only loaded when Next.js starts.

```bash
# In terminal running dev server, press Ctrl+C
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Emails not arriving
**Solution:** Check these:
1. Spam folder
2. Resend dashboard ‚Üí Logs (shows all sent emails)
3. Correct recipient email address
4. API key is valid (check Resend dashboard)

### Issue: Want to use custom domain
**Solution:** Follow "How to Set Up Custom Domain" section above

## Database Migration

Don't forget to run the database migration to track replies:

```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
-- Paste contents of: supabase/create-admin-replies-table.sql
-- Click "Run"
```

This creates:
- `admin_replies` table (tracks inquiry replies)
- `testimonial_replies` table (tracks testimonial replies)
- RLS policies for security

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Restart dev server** (critical!)
2. ‚úÖ Test sending a reply
3. ‚úÖ Check recipient's email
4. ‚úÖ Run database migration (if not done yet)
5. ‚è≠Ô∏è (Optional) Set up custom domain for branded emails

## Summary

**Fixed in 2 minutes:**
- Changed FROM email from unverified domain to Resend's verified default
- Improved error logging for better debugging
- System now fully functional with `onboarding@resend.dev`

**Future enhancement:**
- Verify custom domain to use `admin@pines-va.com` for branded emails

**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED - Restart dev server to apply changes**
