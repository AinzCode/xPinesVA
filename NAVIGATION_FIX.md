# 🛠️ Navigation Fix Complete - Expertise Pages

## ✅ **Issue Fixed: Missing Navigation on VA Detail Pages**

**Problem**: When users clicked on individual VA service pages (GVA, EVA, ISA, VMA) from the expertise section, the navigation bar was missing, making it difficult to navigate back or access other parts of the website.

**Solution**: Added Navigation and Footer components to all individual VA service pages.
