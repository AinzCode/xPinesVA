## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. **Check Supabase project** - Is it paused? (Free tier pauses after 7 days)
2. **Check environment variables** - Is `.env.local` correct?
3. **Check authentication** - Are you logged in as admin?

Run `diagnose-realtime.sql` - it will tell you exactly what's wrong!

## 💡 What the Code Does Now

✨ **Auto-retry**: Tries 3 times with 2-second delays
✨ **Better logging**: Uses warnings instead of errors for temporary issues
✨ **Clear status**: Shows exactly what's happening in console

## 📞 Test It

1. Open admin dashboard (`/admin/testimonials`)
2. Open another tab (`/testimonials/submit`)
3. Submit a test testimonial
4. Should see instant notification in admin dashboard! 🎉
