✅ After successful project completion  
✅ 1-2 weeks into service (for ongoing clients)  
✅ After milestone achievements  
✅ When client expresses satisfaction  
✅ 3-month and 6-month anniversaries  

❌ Avoid:
- During onboarding (too early)
- When issues are unresolved
- Too frequently (quarterly max)

---

### **How to Ask**:

**Good**:
- "We'd love to hear about your experience!"
- "Your feedback helps other businesses discover us"
- "Share your story in just 2 minutes"
- "Help us improve and celebrate your success"

**Avoid**:
- "Please give us 5 stars"
- "We need reviews"
- Pressure or obligation language
- Incentives for positive reviews only

---

## 🎁 Incentive Ideas (Optional)

Consider offering:
- Entry into monthly drawing
- Discount on next service
